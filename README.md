debouncing:

typing slow = 200ms
typing fast = 30ms

Performance:
- iphone pro max = 14 letter * 1000 = 14000
- with debouncing = 3 api calls * 1000 = 3000

debouncing with 200ms
- if difference between 2 key strokes is <200ms - decline api call
- >200ms make an api call



Cache:
time complexity to search in arrau = O(n)
time complexity to search in object = O(1)
